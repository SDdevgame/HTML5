        <h1> What is Dungeon Keeper? </h1>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper?scrlybrkr" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper</a> is a strategy video game developed by Bullfrog Productions and released by Electronic Arts in June 1997 for MS-DOS and Windows 95. In Dungeon Keeper, the player builds and manages a dungeon, protecting it from invading 'hero' characters intent on stealing accumulated treasures, killing monsters, and ultimately the player's demise. The ultimate goal is to conquer the world by destroying the heroic forces and rival dungeon keepers in each realm. A character known as the Avatar (resembling the Avatar from Ultima VIII: Pagan) appears as the final hero. Dungeon Keeper uses Creative Technology's SoundFont technology to enhance its atmosphere. Multiplayer with up to four players is supported using a modem, or over a local network. The game also influenced <a href="Minecraft.html" target="_blank">Minecraft</a>
