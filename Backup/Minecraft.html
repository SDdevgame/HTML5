        <h1> What is Minecraft? </h1>
        <p> Minecraft is a sandbox construction game created by Mojang AB founder Markus "Notch" Persson, inspired by <a href="Infiniminer.html" target="_blank">Infiniminer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_Fortress" target="_blank">Dwarf Fortress</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper?scrlybrkr" target="_blank">Dungeon Keeper</a>, and Notch's past games Legend of the Chambered and RubyDung. Gameplay involves players interacting with the game world by placing and breaking various types of blocks in a three-dimensional environment. In this environment, players can build creative structures, creations, and artwork on multiplayer servers and singleplayer worlds across multiple game modes.
        </p>
        <p> On September 18, 2017, the original version of Minecraft was renamed to Minecraft: Java Edition. Shortly thereafter, on September 20, 2017, the Better Together Update for Bedrock Edition was released on Android, iOS, Fire OS, Windows 10, Samsung Gear VR, and Fire TV, and the editions Pocket Edition, Windows 10 Edition, Gear VR Edition, and Fire TV Edition were then renamed to have the single title Minecraft with no edition name. A port of Bedrock Edition to the Xbox One platform was released that day, discontinuing and replacing the original Xbox One Edition, and a port of Bedrock to the Nintendo Switch platform was released June 21, 2018, discontinuing and replacing the original Nintendo Switch Edition.
        </p>
        <p> As of January 20, 2018, Minecraft has sold 144 million copies across all platforms, making it the second best-selling video game of all time, and the ninth best-selling video game franchise of all time.
