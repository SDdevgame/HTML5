        <h1> What is Infiniminer? </h1>
        <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zachtronics?scrlybrkr#Infiniminer" target="_blank">Infiniminer</a> is an open source multi-player block-based sandbox building and digging game, in which the player is a miner searching for minerals by carving tunnels through procedurally generated maps and building structures. According to the author Barth, it was based on the earlier games Infinifrag, Team Fortress, and Motherload by XGen Studios.
        </p>
        <p> Barth wrote Infiniminer in his spare time, with the help of a friend, and released it in steps of incremental updates during Aprilâ€“May 2009. It quickly garnered a following on message boards around the Internet.
        </p>
        <p> Infiniminer was originally intended to be played as a team-based competitive game, where the goal is to locate and excavate precious metals, and bring the findings to the surface to earn points for the player's team. However, as the game gained popularity, players gravitated towards the emergent gameplay functionality of building in-world objects, instead of the stated design goal of competition.
        </p>
        <p>Zachtronics discontinued development of the game less than a month after its first release as the result of its source code leak. As Barth had not obfuscated the C# .NET source code of the game, it was decompiled and extracted from the binaries. Hackers modified the code to make mods, but also started making clients that would target vulnerabilities in the game as well as build incompatible game forks that fragmented its user base. Barth, who was making the game for free, then lost interest and dropped the project, as development of the game had become too difficult. The source code of Infiniminer is now available under the MIT License. Building Infiniminer requires Visual Studio 2008 and XNA Game Studio 3.0.
        </p>
        <p>Infiniminer is the game that <a href="Minecraft.html" target="_blank">Minecraft</a> was initially inspired by (and subsequently FortressCraft, CraftWorld and Ace of Spades). The visuals and mechanics of procedural generation and terrain deformation of Minecraft were drawn from Infiniminer. According to Minecraft author Markus Persson, after he discovered Infiniminer, he "decided it was the game he wanted to do".
